Analytics and data engineering teams who build data pipelines frequently need to:
* Standardize data coming from different source systems.
* Manage configuration data for their ETLs.
* Manage local referential data.

This often requires to build **small dimension tables, lists of values or mappings**. It is frequent to do it in spreadsheets or directly in the database but as your project grows such practices can quickly become unmanageable and prompt to error...

**ListOf provides a simple and flexible solution to manage configuration data, aka lists of values**.
In particular:
- Create, update, delete lists of values with custom structures.
- Create relationships and mappings between your lists of values.
- Expose your lists of values via a web API (GraphQL) or in a database (PostgreSQL).
