# ListOf
All data warehousing projects face a similar need to manage small dimension tables, lists of values or mappings to standardize data coming from different source systems. It is frequent to do it in spreadsheets but as your project grows those can quickly become unmanageable...

The objective of **ListOf** is to answer this need by providing a simple and flexible application to manage lists of values. ListOf provides a friendly user interface to:
- Create / update / delete list entities, a list corresponds to a table in ListOf database.
- Create / updated / delete list attributes, an attribute corresponds to a table column in ListOf database.
- Insert / update / delete values in lists, a value is a record in ListOf database.

In addition to managing lists of values, ListOf exposes them via a GraphQL API.
