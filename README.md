# ListOf
All data warehousing projects usually face similar needs to manage small dimension tables, lists of static values or mappings to standardize data coming from different source systems. It is frequent to see teams doing it in Microsoft Excel but as your project grows it can quickly become unmanageable...

The objective of **ListOf** is to answer this need by providing a simple and flexible application to manage lists of values. It provides a friendly user interface allowing you to:
- Create / update / delete lists entities, a list corresponds to a table in the ListOf database.
- Create / updated / delete lists attributes, an attribute corresponds to a column in a list table.
- Insert / update / delete values in the lists, a value is a record in a list table.
- Expose lists of values via a GraphQL API.
