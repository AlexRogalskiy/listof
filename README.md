All data warehousing projects face similar challenges to standardize data coming from different source systems. This often requires to manage **small dimension tables, lists of values or mappings**. It is frequent to do it in spreadsheets but as your project grows those can quickly become unmanageable...

**ListOf** provides a simple and flexible solution to manage lists of values. In particular:
- Create, update, delete lists of values with custom structures.
- Create relationships and mappings between lists of values.
- Expose lists of values via a web API (GraphQL) or in a database (PostgreSQL).
